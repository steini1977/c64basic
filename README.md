# c64basic
my commodore 64 basic programs.

I have made these programs in vice-c64. 
they will work on real computers to.
These commands are in low case here.

If you copy these codes to vice c64, they will appere high cased. That's normal.

if you write them on a real commodore64, they will also appear hicased. that's also normal.

good luck.
